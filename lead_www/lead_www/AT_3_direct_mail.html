                                    </h2>

                                    <p></p>

                                    <p>
                                        Here’s what’s great about every door direct.Instead of mailing to specific names and addresses, the United States Postal Services Every Door Direct Mail Program (EDDM) program allows you to have your mail pieces delivered to individual neighborhoods(by carrier routes). You simply select the carrier route on the USPS “Every Door Direct Online Tool” and pinpoint your audience that you would like to deliver to. The result will be that the USPS will deliver directly to every mailbox on that route. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        With Every Door Direct mail service there’s no need to buy addresses or mailing lists. Instead, you can focus your real estate agent marketing on potential customers within a specific radius of the zip code or area you want to target. This is extremely beneficial to real estate agents since this is the same strategy that agents use when we choose a farming area to market in.  So, if you currently have an area that you are farming you can blanket mail to the same area without having to every home address and without paying the cost of standard first class mail.  The cost savings of the Every Door Direct Marketing are huge and you can save up to 30% to 70% off of the normal mailing cost by using this extremely effective mailing program.
                                    </p>

                                        THE PROBLEM WITH THE WAY AGENTS CURRENTLY USE DIRECT MAIL 
                                    </h2>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                    	95% of real estate agents direct mail marketing campaigns are designed to target listings (sellers). Most agents fail with direct mail and end up quitting this highly effective source of lead generation before they have ever really given it a chance.  This is really unfortunate because direct mail marketing when done the right way is extremely effective and can yield massive results.    
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        <b>Here are the two major reasons why agents fail with direct mail:</b>
                                    </p>

                                    <ol>
                                        <li>
                                            Their direct mail marketing strategy is flawed. In most cases agents sent out their postcards hoping to time the arrival of a postcard with the exact time the home seller is ready to sell. The likelihood of a homeowner “holding on to a postcard” until they are ready to sell is slim to none.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            When agents send out there “just sold” or “just listed” direct mail campaigns, there is no clear<u> Call To Action</u> or the <u>Call To Action</u> is asking the seller to do too much. We have found in most cases that the agent’s call to action requests that the seller “call now” to list their home. Now think about that for a moment. You are asking a total stranger who has never met you and only knows you from the mailings to “pick up the phone and talk to you about selling their home”. You are asking a complete stranger to make a call to you so that you can handle the most important financial transaction of their life. You’re asking them to do an “all or nothing” thing. And even if they were interested in your services at some other point in time, you have no way of capturing their contact information unless they actually call you.  
                                        </li>
                                    </ol>

                                    <p>
                                        So, when you “hope that your mailing reaches the seller at the exact same time they are ready to sell” and you ask that homeowner to “just call you” to list their home, what do you think the odds are that is really going to happen? LOW, LOW, LOW. The good news is that we do have the solution that will stack the odds in your favor and that will absolutely produce the results that you SHOULD OF BEEN getting long ago in your direct mail campaign.

                                    	Regardless of which campaign you go with, you will be targeting homeowners (SELLERS) within a radius of the property you will be using for your <u>“Just Listed or Just Sold”</u> postcard.   The most flexible choice would be the <u>“Just Sold”</u> campaign. This is because you can either use a listing that you <u>“Just Sold”</u> or use an office co-workers listing OR you can go on the MLS and locate another agents listing that <u>“Just Sold”</u> in the area that you want to mail to.  However CONSULT YOUR BROKER IF YOU CHOOSE TO MARKET ANOTHER AGENTS <u>“JUST SOLD”</u> LISTING SINCE RULES VARY FROM MLS TO MLS.

                                    <p>
                                        If you choose to do a <u>“Just Listed”</u> campaign, this is perfect when you have your own listing to market.  If you do not have your own “Just Listed” listing, YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY NEED PERMISSION from the listing agent to advertise their property. However, we have found that in 90% of the cases MOST agents will give you permission because they are happy to get the help with the caveat that they need to see your marketing piece first.

                                        Once you have decided on the campaign you will run, you will need a clear “Front Photo” of the home you are going to feature. This will be used in your postcard so be sure it’s a photo that you think will work well.

                                        We recommend if it’s your first mailing, delivering to minimally 500 homes, but no more than 1000 houses. You can always mail more after your first campaign. You will find that MOST printers offer STEEP price reductions on postcards when you reach the 1000 card mark. For EDDM mail you are able to mail up to 5000 pieces at one time.

                                        You need to be aware that it’s possible that the carrier routes you choose will cross over into other cities, zip codes, and counties so you need to know the following: <b>Are you going to have your Landing Page HEADLINE (STEP 5) be the city name? Or zip code? Or area name?</b> Just make sure the routes you choose reflect your game plan. Because in the next step you will need to place the “name” of the area you are delivering to on to the postcard headline. The routes you choose in this step ALL need to be located in the same “area” (City,County,orZip) that you place on your postcard headline. EXAMPLE: If you use the city name “San Francisco”, you need to be sure that all the routes you choose in this step are located in the city of “San Francisco”.

                                      <p>
                                        You will need to buy a domain. This domain “name” needs to be congruent with the area that you will be mailing your postcards to.  You have already decided what area you will be mailing to when you selected your carrier routes   
                                      </p>

                                            The domain name you choose should have the first 2 words “home value” contained in it.  For example, if you were doing a mailing in the city of “Seattle”, the domain name could be <b><a href="homevalueseattle.com">(homevalueseattle.com)</a></b>.Ideally your domain should be less than 20 characters. If the area you are mailing to has a long name OR the name you choose is “taken”,you should abbreviate the name. For example, if you were doing a mailing in San Francisco you could do (homevaluesf.com). <b>MAKE SURE THE NAME YOU CHOOSE MATCHES WITH THE MAIL ROUTES AREA YOU ARE DELIVERING TO IN STEP 4</b>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Once you come up with a “domain name”, place it in the “search domain” box (above) to see if it’s available.  If it’s not available then try another name. If it is available, purchase the domain name inside of your GODADDY.COM account. <b>ONLY PURCHASE THE .COM version.</b> You will be offered to purchase other versions (.NET .TV .US etc.) as well as “other services” but you do not need these.When you get to the final CHECKOUT page, the system will default to “5 Years of Service” for the domain you are buying. <b>Make sure to change this option to “1 YEAR” of service.</b>
                                        </li>

                                            In the end, the domain you buy should cost a TOTAL between $10- $20. If it is more than $20 something is wrong and you need to remove any extra services that were added. 
                                        </li>

                                    <p>
                                        We need a “URL” to place on the postcard to direct seller traffic to your landing page. You could always use the URL that you generated by creating a landing page in your ALGDASH.COM. The URL that you had generated in step 5 looks something like this    www.algdash.com/seattle.  If you were a home seller that just received a postcard that told you to go to www.algdash.com/seattle, it’s fairly difficult to remember plus it really has no meaning to you as a home seller. Now, if you received a postcard that told you the homeowner to go to www.homevalueseattle.com it would carry more meaning to you and it is more memorable. So what we will do in this step is to take your new Go Daddy domain you purchased and “FORWARD”   that to your ALGDASH.COM domain (URL). So the homeowner would now enter in the GODADDY domain you just purchased,but they will be redirected to your landing page at WWW.ALGDASH.COM. 
                                    </p>

                                     <p>
                                        Go to step 4 in this guide and <b>locate the “forms”</b> that you should of saved for this step. If for some reason you can’t locate the forms DON’T WORRY because SO FAR you have paid nothing to the USPS!  You can <b>“RE-DO” step 4</b> as long as you stay in the same location you were originally in when you decided the postal carrier <b>“Delivery Routes”</b>. You can do this as long as you deliver to the same number of houses (OR LESS) than you originally had planned on doing. 
                                     </p>

                                     <p>Here are the forms you should have: </p>

                                     <p><b>THE FORMS YOU RECEIVE WILL BE: </b></p>

                                     <ol>
                                        <li>Post Office Locations And Drop Information Form &rarr; It will be “Pre-Populated” with your mailing info and tells you the locations of the Post Offices you need to go to.</li>

                                        <li> Mailing Statement (USPS FORM 3587) &rarr; you will need to fill in some information. There will be 2 pages of this piece. </li>

                                        <li>Facing Slips &rarr; (You will need to print more so you have one for each bundle) </li>
                                     </ol>

                                     <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            When your postcards arrive you will bundle them in groups of 100. For example 1000 postcards would equal 10 bundles of 100. The final bundle will have the pieces that aren’t in a bundle of 100. <b>Example:</b>  Say you have 1255 pieces in your routes. You would have (12 Bundles of 100) and (1 Bundle of 55) for a total of “13 bundles” 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            You will need to fill out <b>EACH “FACING SLIP”</b> and place <b>(1) “FACING SLIP”</b> on <b>EVERY BUNDLE</b> with a rubber band around it.  The USPS does not provide you <b>ALL</b> of the facing slips so you will need to <b>“make copies”</b> so that <b>EACH ONE</b> of your bundles has a facing slip. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Deliver your bundles and ALL paperwork to the post office specified in the order summary and pay for your order. The post office clerk can help you with your  paperwork should you need it 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            It is possible that the routes you have chosen will require you to go to more than one Post Office. 
                                        </li>
                                     </ul>

                                     <p>
                                        If that is the case, at the FIRST Post Office you go toyou will bring ALL the paperwork and pay for the entire mailing there and drop off the bundles that are for that post office. You will then take your receipt and remaining bundles and deliver them to any other post offices that you need to go to.  END
