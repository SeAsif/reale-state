                                    	Similar to other methods of advertising, Facebook ads is dependent on budget. The more money you spend, the larger your reach (the number of people your ad is shown to). That being said, after lots of trial and error we have found $5 to $10 a day for one week is sufficient. . Remember, if things are going well, you can always add more money and extend the length of the Ad. Plan to review your results but give it time! 
                                    </p>

                                    	For “SCHEDULE”, Facebook will default to “RUN MY AD CONTINUOUSLY STARTING TODAY”. Change that setting to “SET A START AND END DATE”.   
                                    </p>

Click on the “END” date box and enter one month from your start date. Click on the time box and enter “8:00 PM”. Double check that you have entered “AM” to start and “PM” to end. You don’t want to waste precious ad time by mixing up the two.
                                    </p>

It is really important to do YOUR best every time. Keep in mind you may get some fake names and phone numbers with these leads. It is normal and to be expected. Don’t get discouraged! Also remember that just because someone isn’t ready to sell or buy right now they may be ready 3 or 6 months down the road. You want them to remember that YOU provided something of value and followed up personally. Stick with it!
